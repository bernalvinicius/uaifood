# UaiFood - Evnts


![Preview-Screens](https://github.com/bernalvinicius/uaifood/blob/master/src/assets/images/screen.png?raw=true)


## Why?


This project is part of the selection process for Front-End Developer sent by PresentEvnts.


The challenge is to make a project that simulates the iFood system. As much as possible, I tried to be faithful to the design provided.

## Functionalities


- Some requirements were passed for the creation of the project:
  - List of restaurants based on city research;
  - Responsive page;
  - Connection with Zomato API;
  - Filters by checkbox (that part are not implemented, only design)


## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

To run this project in the development mode, you'll need to have a basic environment to run a React App, that can be found [here.](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)


### Installing


**Cloning this repository**


```
$ https://github.com/bernalvinicius/uaifood.git
$ cd uaifood
```


**Installing Dependencies**


```
$ yarn
```


_or_

```
$ npm install
```


**Running**


With all dependencies installed and the environment properly configured, you can now run the app:

```
$ npm start
```


## Built With


**Obs:** Below I will talk about some plugins, all of them in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).


After generating a new project with 'npx create-react-app', I created some extra files to leave the application preconfigured in compilation and indentation levels.


The following files were created: (at the root of the project):


- **.editorconfig:**


For this file to be valid, it must be added the extension [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig). With the extension installed and the file created, you can define certain code style indications. Things like how many spaces a tab should have. This can reduce friction when working with a team of multiple programmers. For more informations: [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/).

- **.prettierrc**


For this file to be valid, it must be added the extension [Prettier â€“ Code formatter](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is nothing more than a code formatter, it ensures that all the code issued is in accordance with a consistent style. For example, you can write a line of code that is too long, you can limit the maximum line length to 60 characters and then Prettier will do the work of organizing the code for you. With the extension installed and the file created, the configuration of the file can be started. For more informations: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).


- **jsconfig.json**

The jsconfig.json file specifies the root files and options for the features provided by the JavaScript service. For example, by default the JavaScript language service will analyze and provide IntelliSense for all files in your JavaScript project. If you want to specify which files to exclude or include to provide the appropriate IntelliSense, you can use a property in jsconfig.json for this. For more informations: [jsconfig.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig).

- **.eslintrc.js**

ESLint is designed to be configurable, you can disable all rules and execute only with basic syntax validation, or mix and match grouped rules and custom rules. We set up ESLint through the .eslintrc.js file, it specifies all the configuration information we want to apply. For more informations: [Documentation of ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring). You must also install the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

After creating all these files and extensions, the following dependencies were installed:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for creating user interfaces
- [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Routes
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) - Linter
- [eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) - This package provides Airbnb .eslintrc as an extensible shared configuration
- [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier#readme) - Disables all rules that are unnecessary or may conflict with Prettier
- [eslint-import-resolver-alias](https://github.com/johvin/eslint-import-resolver-alias#readme) - This is a simple Node.js module import resolution plugin for eslint-plugin-import, which supports native Node.js module resolution, alias / mapping module and custom file extensions.
- [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import) - This plugin supports ES2015 + import/export syntax (ES6 +) and avoids problems with misspellings of file paths and import names
- [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y#readme) - Static AST (abstract syntax tree) checker for accessibility rules in JSX elements
- [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier#readme) - Run Prettier as an ESLint rule and report differences as individual ESLint problems
- [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) - Specific learning rules for ESLint
- [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://github.com/facebook/react) - Apply the Hooks rules
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) - Code formatter
- [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) - Runtime type checking for React props and similar objects. You can use prop-types to document the intended types of properties passed to components. React will check past props for its components against these definitions and notify them in development if they do not match
- [customize-cra](https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra#readme) - Provides a set of utilities to customize the settings of versions 02 and 03 of create-react-app, taking advantage of the main features of react-app-rewired
- [customize-cra-react-refresh](https://github.com/esetnik/customize-cra-react-refresh#readme) - Provides a simple way to integrate react-refresh into your create-react-app using customize-cra and @pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin
